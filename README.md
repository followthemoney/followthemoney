# Follow the money - A transparent crowdfunding platform

See how every cent of your donation is spent and be sure that it's really working for the cause!

Not a lot of people give money to charity because it's unclear for them how will their money be spent. People are not greedy, they just don't want to be bamboozled!

Our platform will let donors track where every cent is going and for NGO's and Charities help to raise funds for their cause.   A lot of people suffered from the pandemic, thus a lot more people need help more than ever. 

People who can afford to help will be happy to help, if they know that their donations will be used the right way!
that's the short description that was submitted for SW. I'll send more info later today
