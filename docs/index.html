        <h1>Follow the money</h1>

        <p>
        How can every cent of your donation is spent and be sure that it's really working for the cause?<br/>
        Not a lot of people give money to charity because it's unclear for them how will their money be spent. People are not greedy, they just don't want to be bamboozled!<br/>
        Our platform let donors track where every cent is going and for NGO's and Charities help to raise funds for their cause.  <br/>
        A lot of people suffered from the pandemic, thus a lot more people need help more than ever. <br/>
        People who can afford to help will be happy to help, if they know that their donations will be used the right way!<br/>
